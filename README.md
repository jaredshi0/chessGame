## Description
Probability Chess is a game that combines traditional chess gameplay with an element of chance. Each capture event has a probability of success based on a probability pool, which can be influenced by player moves. The game is played on a standard 8x8 chessboard, and each player starts with a standard set of chess pieces. Unlike traditional chess, there is no concept of check or checkmate; the goal is to capture the opponents king directly.
